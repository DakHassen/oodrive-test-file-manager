## Summary

The goal of this technical test is to code a small file manager.

The mandatory features are the following:
- display the root files and folders
- upload a file
- download a file

From there, you can add all the features you want, including but not limited to:
- navigate inside folders
- use routing for navigation
- rename a file or folder
- create a new folder
- move a file / folder to another folder
- delete a file or a folder
- upload multiple files / folders
- upload through drag and drop
- make the app responsive

This should take 3 to 6 hours of your time. We suggest you don't spend too much time on CSS or on browser compatibility. Just target one evergreen browser.

Although we are working with Angular at Oodrive, there is _no limitation_ in the frameworks and libraries you can use for this test.

The repository is initialized with **TypeScript** and **Sass** but supports **JavaScript** and **CSS** as well. That being said, you can change anything you want.

The following branches with the appropriate tooling have also been initialized:
- [Angular](https://github.com/oodrive/front-technical-test#angular)
- [React](https://github.com/oodrive/front-technical-test#react)

## Quick start
